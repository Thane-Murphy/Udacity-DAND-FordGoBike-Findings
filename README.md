# Udacity-DAND-FordGoBike-Findings

This dataset provides comprehensive insights into individual rides within a bike-sharing system spanning the greater San Francisco Bay area. It encompasses crucial details such as trip durations, start and end times, station IDs, locations, user types (customer or subscriber), gender, birth years, and bike IDs. Notably, the program was launched on June 28th, 2017, and this dataset captures information from that inception date onwards. While no specific data has been intentionally removed, efforts have been made to fill in missing information in certain columns with placeholder values denoting "unknown."

# Summary of Findings
Upon conducting an analysis, I have found the gathered information to be instrumental in identifying optimal times and days for observing bikers in San Francisco. The examination of data from major cities proved particularly beneficial in comprehending the extent of bike usage. It is imperative to consider various variables to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the data. Factors such as frequency of use, duration, timing, user classification (Subscriber/Customer), and associated metrics were meticulously examined. This rigorous investigation yielded valuable insights into traffic patterns and preferred biking times. Through this analysis, it can be inferred that bike utilization peaks during early working hours and experiences a subsequent surge in returns between 4-6pm.
